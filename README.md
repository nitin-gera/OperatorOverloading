# OperatorOverloading
Operator Overloading Demonstration

This project demonstrates overloading of operators such as + for adding complex numbers.
It also demonstrates overloading of << operator to use cout with class.
The class objects are also stored in standard STL containers such as map and set by overloading the '<' operator
